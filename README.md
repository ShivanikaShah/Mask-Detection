# Mask-Surveillance

A deeplearning based solution for identying individuals not wearing a mask. The solution comprises of three modules:

### 1. Face detection:
The Face detection method is used to find the faces present in the image, extract the faces, and display it

### 2. Mask Detection:
A neural network based classification model that can classify masked and unmasked face images

### 3. Face Recognition:
A SVM classifier enabled using Facenet compares the test image with the database of individuals and helps recognize both masked and unmasked individuals.
